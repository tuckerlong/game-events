And will elaborate the current development status one by one.    \n\n[list]\n[*] Character Growth Section Renewal  \n[*] The 3rd Space Time Distortion: The Watcher’s Temple  \n[*] 26th New Hero Update  \n[/list]\n\n  \n\n[b][Character Growth Section Renewal]   \n[/b]\nThe Character Growth Section Renewal is scheduled for November.    \n\nSince there will be some significant changes to familiar gameplay patterns, I’d like to highlight the key aspects that will change, as outlined in this October DEV Note: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[b]1. Story Progression Process:  \n[/b]\nStories that can be considered as tutorial will be excluded from the main story line, allowing players to focus solely on the main story of Vindictus.  \n\nPlayers can choose to skip story dialogues; those who opt to skip will no longer need to click through each dialogue to proceed.\n\nHowever, some dialogues may not offer the skip option. Even so, we’re working to minimize the time required for story progression. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[b]2. Shortened Battle Progress:  \n[/b]\nAfter skipping the story, players can jump directly to boss battles, bypassing regular monster battles, which will streamline progression and reduce combat time.\n\nI hope this renewal will create a smoother playing experience with more efficient paths and shorter battles.\n\nTo avoid making boss battles too quick or mechanical, I also plan to adjust the balance of boss monsters to enhance the leveling experience and deliver enjoyable action gameplay. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n[b]3. Revised Rewards in Growth Phase:  \n[/b]\nWe plan to reduce the amount of gold earned from battles and story completions, replacing lower-value items with items essential for growth.\n\nEquipment, AP, fatigue potions, and other necessities will be provided abundantly in the growth section, supporting players in preparing for raid battles through the main storyline. To offset the reduced gold, various missions and an adjustment in the cost of level 110 enhancements will help maintain smooth progression. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n[b]4. Renewed Guide System:  \n[/b]\nAs character growth paths change, the guide system will be updated accordingly.\n\nPlay guide missions can now be completed regardless of stage, and missions such as redeemer clearance requirements will be adjusted to match the faster growth pace.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, minor updates will be made, such as advancing key skills acquisition times for certain characters, increasing Red Moon’s Energy Battle EXP, and so on. We will continue to monitor feedback from players on these changes. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n[b][Space Time Distortion: The Watcher’s Temple]  \n[/b]\nThe 3rd Space-Time Distortion, The Watcher’s Temple, is scheduled for November.\n\nThe test server will open on November 6th, with the Character Growth Section going live on November 14th and the full Space-Time Distortion update on November 21st.\n\nThis schedule allows players to experience the Character Growth Section for one week and the Space-Time Distortion for two weeks on the test server.  \n\n\n\n\nIn the first test week, only the initial phases of Space-Time Distortion will be available, with the full battle opening the following week. \n\nWe will gather feedback and fix bugs as needed, addressing critical issues promptly regardless of the update schedule.\n\n\n\n\nStat requirements for the new Space-Time Distortion will be announced when the test server opens.\n\nTo ensure smooth testing, my team and I will patch unintended errors and provide stat-boosting items as needed.  \n\n\n\n\nThe diverse attack patterns from Jordra and Jörmungandr will challenge our testers, but I believe our players’ skill will conquer this battle even before the official release. \n\nThe top-tier battle rewards for the 3rd Space-Time Distortion will include new artifacts and exclusive enchantments, granting additional effects based on artifact-enchantment combinations for optimized usage.  \n\n\n\n\nMagic extraction will also become available for the Fallen One’s Rhod Compass, which will remain the highest-tier item without new Rhod Compass additions.  \n\nThis new Space-Time Distortion features a more captivating design, and I hope you look forward to its release. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n[b][26th Hero] \n[/b]\nThe 26th Heroine is scheduled for release this winter; however, I must announce that the planned December release will be postponed to January 2025.  \n\nAfter careful consideration, I concluded that a January 2025 release would align better with the 15th Anniversary and Lunar New Year.  \n\nAlongside the new hero release, a Golden Time Event will also occur in January.\n\nAlthough the release has been delayed, we are preparing a special end-of-year event to celebrate with you. Thank you for understanding this schedule change. \n\n\n\n\nThe 26th Hero marks a fresh attempt by our development team, and while details will be shared at a later time, I appreciate your patience as we finalize this exciting addition. \n\n[i]Note: For regions outside Korea, the delayed schedule does not apply, and development is proceeding as initially planned. [/i","Celebrate 14th Anniversary & Halloween!":"https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/94040/fourteen-years-old-check-in-event ]For full reward details, click here.  \n[/url]\n \n\n[h3]Community: 14 years with Vindictus!\n[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Event Period: October 22, 2024 - November 19, 2024 \n[/list]\n \n\nJoin us on Discord to share your memories with fellow Mercenaries in our “14 Years with Vindictus” event! \n\nTell your story and receive special gifts! \n\n \n\n[url=https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/94364/14-years-with-vindictus ]Find out more here. [/url]\n\n \n\n[h2]<Halloween Events> \n[/h2]\n \n\n[h3]Happy Halloween Welcome Gift Box\n[/h3]\n \n\nTo celebrate Halloween, we have prepared a special gift for you! \n[list][*]Coupon code: [spoiler]HALLOWEENHERO[/spoiler] [/*][/list][list][*]Expiration date: 2024-11-26 07:00 UTC [/*][/list][list][*]Available once per account [/*][/list][table][tr][td]\nItem \n[/td][td]\nDescription \n[/td][td]\nDetails \n[/td][/tr][tr][td]\nHappy Halloween Welcome Gift Box \n[/td][td]\nAvailable once per account \n[list][*]All contents are available until 2024-11-26 07:00 UTC. [/*][/list][/td][td]\nObtain Welcome Boost Package by opening \n[/td][/tr][/table]\n \n\nWelcome Boost Package contents \n[table][tr][td]\nItem \n[/td][td]\nQty. \n[/td][td]\nTradability \n[/td][td]\nExpiration \n[/td][/tr][tr][td]\nVVIP Service (15 Days) \n[/td][td]\n1 \n[/td][td]\nBound to Character \n[/td][td]\n2024-11-26 07:00 UTC \n[/td][/tr][tr][td]\nAirtight Cadet Badge (15 Days) \n[/td][td]\n1 \n[/td][td]\nCan use Shared Storage \n[/td][td]\n2024-11-26 07:00 UTC \n[/td][/tr][tr][td]\nAP Boost (15 Days) [AS] \n[/td][td]\n1 \n[/td][td]\nAccount Shareable \n[/td][td]\n2024-11-26 07:00 UTC \n[/td][/tr][tr][td]\nTP Boost (15 Days) [AS] \n[/td][td]\n1 \n[/td][td]\nAccount Shareable \n[/td][td]\n2024-11-26 07:00 UTC \n[/td][/tr][/table]\n \n\n[How to use Coupons] \n[olist][*] Access Vindictus[/*][*] Click ‘Supply Depot’ in the bottom right corner.[/*][*] Select ‘Enter Coupon.’[/*][*] Enter the coupon code and click ‘Redeem Coupon.’[/*][/olist]\nYour rewards will be in the ‘Storage Chest (B)’ under ‘NX Storage Chest > Temporary.’ \n\n \n\n[h3]Witch’s Murky Cauldron Event\n[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Event Period: 10/15/2024 - 11/5/2024  \n[/list]\n \n\nSpeak to the Strange Traveler in Colhen and complete daily missions to collect Murky Magic Ingredients. \n\nFor every 5 ingredients you turn in, you’ll earn a reward and progress to the next stage!  \n\n \n\n[url=https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/94039/witch-s-murky-cauldron-event ]Click here to check out the event and its reward! \n[/url] \n\n\n\n[h3]GM COIN S4: VindiGhosts\n[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Event Period: 10/15/2024 (Tue) after weekly maintenance - 11/19/2024 (Tue) before weekly maintenance \n[/list]\n \n\nJoin the fun by sharing a screenshot of your “Spooky Outfit Set” and “Bat Balloon Box” from the Witch’s Murky Cauldron Event in [url=https://discord.gg/vindictus]our Discord[/url]’s #vindighosts channel. \nIf 70 or more players participate, everyone will receive 15 GM Coins to exchange for in-game items! \n\n \n\nMore details can be found [url=https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/94291/gm-coin-s4-vindighosts]here[/url] and [url=https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/90322/gm-coin-event-season-4]here[/url].  \n \n\nStay tuned to our [url=https://vindictus.nexon.net/news]news page[/url","[CMTY] 14 years with Vindictus!":"https://discord.gg/vindictus]on our official Discord[/url] and earn special gifts we've prepared for you!\n\n \n\n[b]Event Period[/b]\n[list][*]October 22, 2024 - November 19, 2024[/*][/list]\n \n\n[b]Q.
