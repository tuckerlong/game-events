This is DEV Allanon, the Director of Vindictus. \n\nFirst, I'd like to apologize for the late Dev Talk. \nI've promised earlier that it'll be revealed by the end of the month.  \n\nIn fact, it was originally planned to be disclosed on the 23rd.\n\nBut due to unexpected internal reasons, we had to delay the release by a week. \nIf further explanation is needed like this time, I will endeavor to expand our communication channels as much as possible. \n \nIn response to feedback from many of our players who felt burdened by the Expertise Proficiency, I've decided to double the Proficiency and Crafting Speed until the Max Level Update. \n \nAdditionally, to build anticipation for the new female character, I dropped a hint during the Dev Talk. \nAnother clue: she is related to a specific character. \n \nAlthough it was unintentional, I inadvertently spoiled a recently updated storyline.\nI will take greater care to prevent such situations from occurring in the future. \n\n[b]Here are some of the inquiries we've received in a Q&A format. [/b]\n\n[b]Q: [/b]Would LV.120 equipment only be craftable through Expertise? \n[quote]A: Yes, LV.120 equipment is planned to be exclusively crafted through Expertise.  \nThis includes weapons, armor, totems, and accessories.  \nTo avoid any confusion, there will be no changes in the equipment available for crafting through each Expertise. [/quote]\n\n[b]Q:[/b] Is maximizing Expertise Proficiency mandatory? \n[quote]A: No, it is not mandatory to have maximum Expertise Proficiency to obtain LV.120 equipment.  \nAlternatively, you can request assistance from other players with the required Expertise level to craft the equipment for you.  \n\nYou may also use binded materials and items when requesting the craft from others. [/quote]\n\n[b]Q: [/b]When crafting LV.120 equipment, will Power Infusion and Quality be transferred? \n[quote]A: We do not plan to transfer Power Infusion and Quality when crafting LV.120 equipment.  \nHowever, enchants will be transferred when using the Extraction Rune during the crafting process. [/quote]\n\n[b]Q:[/b] Will LV.120 Armor be updated in the order of [Head – Chest – Leg – Hand – Foot]? \n[quote] A: The plan for updating LV120 equipment is as follows: \n[table]\t\t\t[tr]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nWeapon (Beginner) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nHead (Beginner~Legend) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nTotem \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t[/tr]\t\t[tr]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nWeapon (Fine) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nLeg (Beginner~Legend) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nEarring \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t[/tr]\t\t[tr]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nWeapon (Superior) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nChest (Beginner~Legend) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nBelt \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t[/tr]\t\t[tr]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nWeapon (Rare) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nHand (Beginner~Legend) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nRing1 \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t[/tr]\t\t[tr]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nWeapon (Legend) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nFoot (Beginner~Legend) \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t\t[td]\t\t\t\nRing2 \n\t\t\t[/td]\t\t[/tr]\t[/table]\n[/quote]\n[b]Q: [/b]Will LV.120 equipment require no enhancement? Does this mean Superior Enhancement Elixir, Enhancement Rune, and Premium Enhancement Rune will no longer be needed? \n[quote]A: Even after reaching LV120, our plan is to retain the necessity of these items when upgrading the item tier. [/quote]\n\n[b]Q: [/b]Will there be a success rate for the LV.120 equipment upgrade? \n[quote]A: We intend to remove any possibility aspects from the upgrade process.  \nPlayers will only need the required materials for the upgrade.We'll monitor closely to determine if further explanation is necessary. [/quote","[COMMUNITY] DevTalk - 7th Episode":" Mercenaries,\n\nDevTalk the 7th Episode is here!\nOur Dev Allanon will introcude what is being planned for Vindictus.\nDon't miss what he has to say!\n[previewyoutube=PWNMTbPWDtI;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nWe also have prepared a gift at the end of the DevTalk.\nPlease watch it through and don’t miss it!\n[list]\n[*","Message from the Dev Team Regarding a New Game Using the Vindictus IP":"o. This is DEV Allanon, the Director of Vindictus.\n\nI would like to deliver the official statement from the dev team to our players following the announcement that Nexon's newly developed game using the Vindictus IP, \"Vindictus: Defying Fate,\" will be entering a pre-alpha test on Steam.\n\n\"Vindictus: Defying Fate\" is a brand-new game that is being developed.\n\nDue to its use of the Vindictus IP, the game will contain familiar characters, NPCs, region names, monsters, and certain outfits.\n\nHowever, \"Vindictus: Defying Fate\" is being developed as a single-player focused game, aiming to be released on console and PC platforms, which moves it in a very different direction from the original Vindictus.\n\nSince their gameplay differs this will have no impact on the service of Vindictus during the development of \"Vindictus: Defying Fate,\" both now and in the future when it is released.\n\nVindictus is still planning to provide content for both short and long-term play, starting with our upcoming progression structure improvements in April and soon followed by our max level expansion this May.\n\nWe will continue to actively deliver our updates and our talks with you, like we have been doing, and as ever we'll do our best to include what you players want to see.\n\nWe anticipate that \"Vindictus: Defying Fate\" will be an opportunity to spread the IP even further out while we continue to maintain Vindictus as the original, and we will work hard to maintain the charm of the original Vindictus that we have built alongside our players.\n\nWe hope to get your continued support for our franchise.\n\nI would like to thank all of our Vindictus players, and I wish nothing but happiness and health for you all.\n\nThank you!\n\n[i","[SALES] Bastion Crystal":"https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/89246]Click HERE for the Sales Details![/url]\n\n[img","[EVENT] Goddess Gift Raid Event":"https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/89248"}}
