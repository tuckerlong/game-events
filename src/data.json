This can be earned only after completing the story quest, ‘Advanced Expertise Artisan.’ \n\nIf you obtain the Artisan rank for Expertise, you can craft or advance(Name TBD) Lv.120 items and can also receive crafting requests. \n\nA crafting request requires the requester to prepare all the materials, and the Artisan can proceed using a stall placed in town. \n\nYou can only have one Artisan rank Expertise per character, but other characters’ Expertise can be shared. \n\nShared Expertise of the sort can still craft items, but it won’t let you place stalls or receive requests. \n\n \n\nYou can also Transfer your Expertise. \n\nYou can only transfer Expertise below 399, before you earn the title of Artisan. When you transfer your Expertise, all the titles you own related to it moves along with it. \n\nWe considered transferring only the expertise proficiency while retaining the titles. \n\nHowever, we're concerned that the transferred character won't be able to acquire titles and that using the transfer system would become mandatory for title retention, leading to a complex situation. Therefore, we've decided to proceed in this manner. \n\nSome Artisan rank Expertise will allow crafting avatar from previous equipment, and the necessary materials can be earned from Niflheim and Special Dungeons. \n\n \n\n[h3][Crafting or advancing Lv.120 items] [/h3]\n\nAs said earlier, you will be able to craft Lv.120 items through Artisan rank Expertise. \n\nA +15 Orna equipment with all stats except the ATT surplus tuned will be used as crafting material, and the crafted item’s exchangeability will follow the material item’s exchange type. \n\nAlso, if you use an extraction rune during crafting, you can also create an item that copies the exact same enchantments from the material item. \n\nThese crafted items start from Normal, and you can advance(Name TBD) them through Beginner – Fine – Superior – Rare – Legendary. \n\n \n\nTo utilize advancements(Name TBD), you need an item called Advance Stone(Name TBD). You can craft them if you have Artisan rank Expertise. \n\nTo craft, you need Essence: Fragments and Inherited Power: Fragements, along with Goibhniu’s Stone, Goibhniu’s Stone+, Superior Enhancement Elixir, etc. \n\nWith this crafted Advance Stone(Name TBD) and some special materials, Jardin Steels, Premium Runes, Premium Runes+, Premium Armor Enhancement Runes, etc. As materials, you can advance (Name TBD) your item. \n\n \n\n[h3][Core Boost] [/h3]\n\nThe Core Boost system will be divided into two groups: Raid Battles and others, with the other group including Special Dungeons, Niflheim, Royal Army and Abyssal Arena. \n\nCore Boost effects apply to 10 Raid Battles and 6 other battles daily, and you can apply Core Boost effects to the desired battle. \n\nIt can be used on a character basis, and when exceeding the number of battles, Core Boost effects will no longer apply. \n\n  \n\nWhen Core Boost effects are applied, you can obtain Core Boost-exclusive items and have a double chance of obtaining major reward. \n\nPreviously, the Core Boost system was planned to provide more rewards and gold, but to ensure a smoother gameplay experience, it has been changed to double the chance of obtaining major rewards only. \n\nWith the application of the Core Boost system, changes in the pattern of playing Battle Circuit are expected, and the groups for Battle Circuit will be further subdivided accordingly. \n\nPlease note that Core Boost effects are not applied in Solo Mode. \n\n \n\n[h3][Others] [/h3","Guide to Reward Changes on 5/1/2024 (Wed) When Clearing Reverent Tower":"https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/91800/guide-to-reward-changes-on-5-1-2024-wed-when-clearing-reverent-tower-5f-15f-25f-and-30f]Please click HERE for the detailed information about the change![/url","[SALES] Spirit Crystal":"https://vindictus.nexon.net/game/prob]Probability Rates[/url]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3953157/c18972750172ce0105f8827cc391e53340e8f204.png[/img]\n\n[url=https://vindictus.nexon.net/news/91084","[CMTY] GM Coin S4: Spring OOTD Event":"]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/3953157/46c36fb6eeea143b70f6f3369516e409aeefdcbe.jpg[/img]\n\nEvent Period: 4/23/2024 (Tue) after weekly maintenance - 5/21/2024 (Tue) before weekly maintenance\n\n[b]Event Details[/b]\n\nShall we change into gorgeous outfits and enjoy the spring vibes together?\n[olist]\n[*] Choose either white, yellow, green, or pink—or mix and match all the colors.\n[*] Show off in the Discord [i]#springootd [/i]channel.[/olist]\nStart this spring off right in Vindictus!\n\n\n[b]Information Needed to Participate:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Title:\n[*] Server:\n[*] Screenshot:\n[/list]\n\n[b]Reward Information[/b]\n[list]\n[*] If more than 80 screenshots are entered in the Discord event channel, then all players will receive 10 GM coins during the 05/21/2024 (Tue.) weekly maintenance.\n[*] If there are not enough participants, only those who participated will receive a coupon code.\n[*"}}
